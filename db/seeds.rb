# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  # recipe = Recipe.create([{ name: 'Chillie' }, { name: 'Carrot' }])
  # Ingredient.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
Recipe.create({ name: 'Chillie' })
